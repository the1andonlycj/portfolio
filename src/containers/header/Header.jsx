        <p>So you have the opportunity to hire me. There are plenty of good reasons to do soâ€”I have a Master's of Fine Arts in writing, a completion certificate from a good coding bootcamp, and I've been working with a PERN stack app that I made from scratch for the past 18 months. I am good at design and even better at making art that involves my dog.</p>

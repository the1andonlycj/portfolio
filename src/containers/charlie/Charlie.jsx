Made in America, California to be exact, I spent some time teaching English in Japan where I ran into a Canadian who lured me away to the frozen north. I live and work in Canada legally (don't worry!), but I've brought a world's worth of experience with me."/>

        <Feature title="Neurology" text="I was the Web-Editor for Stanford's Neuroscience Department. I got the job because I knew enough about brain science to talk to the doctors and enough about programming to put their work into words for the web."/>
        <Feature title="Teaching" text="I studied neuroscience concepts to become a better educatorâ€”to know what was going on in someone's head before they said it. I bring that knowledge to programming, talking, and every design decision I make."/>
        <Feature title="Ultimate" text="I threw a frisbee tournament in Japan. When I'm not injured, I'm pretty obsessed with the sport. I had an article published in Sky'd Magazine about it. (This trivia included as proof of strangeness, not necessarily hireability.)"/>

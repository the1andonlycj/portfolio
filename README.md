# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and it features some of the work that I have done up to now. Though much of this site was completed by following a tutorial, the artwork, styling, and some of the features are fully my own implementations. I'm most proud of the Modal component, which handles showing gifs of my projectsâ€”I made it from scratch, and tried to keep it as elegant as possible in its implementation. It's the first thing you see when arriving on the site, though there is more content below.

Feel free to check out the Github pages for the other projects I completed during boot camp, namely Mappy Trails and Sure Sheets, for which I contributed the majority of the front end code, styling, and overall "user story". You can get to them by simply clicking their links. I would share Renegade with you, but it's still under construction and hasn't been deployed to the net. The gif is fairly self-explanatory, though: a full stack app with a lot of style, including an interactive "confidence crank", support for Google Charts, and custom everything.
